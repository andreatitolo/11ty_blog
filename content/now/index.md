# Now

Hi! this is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). 

## Living

I'm currently living in Rome, Italy. I am planning to move to Turin before the end of 2023.

## Reading

Recently I am rarely reading one book at the time. However, I am currently reading [The Utopia of Rules by David Graeber](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17840829W/The_Utopia_of_Rules?edition=key%3A/books/OL26427310M).

## Playing

As with books, I rarely play only one videogame at the time. Since Diablo IV came out, I am mostly playing that (Rogue class). I put on hold Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, but I plan to finish it soon. Also sometimes I do a few matches here and there of Crusader Kings III and Hearts of Iron IV.

## Watching

I am actively watching Silo, which started slowly but now I am really enjoying it (and the slow pace of a weekly episode) and Ted Lasso. Less demanding but still highly enjoyable is Vinland Saga (Season 2). I put on hold Mr. Robot, but I plan to restart watching it soon.

## Learning

I am trying to learn webdev and strengthening my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Sooner or later I need to make peace with the fact that I want to learn Vim too.

## Work

Currently at the University of Turin as Post-doctoral research associate. I am also teaching a student-lab about Landscape Archaeology and GIS at Sapienza University of Rome.
